## How to use my software?

First of all we need to create a virtual environment for the Python programming language, using this command on the terminal:

```
python3 venv venv
```

Now, we need to "activate" the virtual environment, using this command on the terminal:

```
source /venv/bin/activate
```

Well, now we install the dependencies with this command, always on the terminal:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

If everything went well, just use the following command:

```
python3 main.py
```

to display the following window on your desktop:

Hey, if you're wondering my name in art is Clever Code that's why you see it in the title of the window!
