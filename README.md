## How to use my software?

First of all we need to create a virtual environment for the Python programming language, using this command on the terminal:

```
python3 venv venv
```

Now, we need to "activate" the virtual environment, using this command on the terminal:

```
source /venv/bin/activate
```

Well, now we install the dependencies with this command, always on the terminal:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
